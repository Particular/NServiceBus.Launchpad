### Choosing A version

The latest stable release is a good place to start. We prerelease the next version so that we can get community feedback. We don't recommend using prerelease software in production environments.

A good name is 
- unique to the system
- able to describe the EndPoint's capability

EndPoint name's are used to name Queues and are used as Identifiers for various views in applications like ServicePulse 
    There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.
